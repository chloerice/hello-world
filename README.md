!Bueno!

I really want to learn to Spanish. I've taken classes in high school, used Rosetta Stone, and mobile apps like Duolingo.
I learned some basic vocab with all of these methods, but lately I've been learning by reading through the trasnlations and memorizing the lyrics of my favorite Calle 13 songs. It's really helped my confidence and flow speaking conversationally!
